## 0.0.9

Released on 2026-01-05.

### Bug fixes

- Emit a diagnostic if a class decorator is not a callable accepting a type ([#22375](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22375))
- Fix exhaustiveness inference for unions that include enums ([#22290](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22290))

### Core type checking

- Support `typing.TypeGuard` ([#20974](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20974))
- Treat `__setattr__` as fallback-only ([#22014](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22014))
- Don't expand type aliases via type mappings unless necessary. This means that the displayed signature of a bound methods will no longer eagerly expand type aliases into their aliased types ([#22241](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22241))
- Narrow `TypedDict` unions with `not in` ([#22349](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22349))
- Don't including `property` in subclasses properties ([#22088](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22088))
- Narrow tagged unions of `TypedDict`s in `match` statements ([#22299](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22299))
- Teach bidirectional inference about subtyping. This allows `x` to be inferred as `list[int]` for `x: Iterable[int] = [42]` ([#21930](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21930))
- Support narrowing for tagged unions of tuples where one element of the tuple is a `Literal` type ([#22303](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22303))

### LSP server

- Add autocomplete suggestions for keyword arguments in `class` statements ([#22110](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22110))
- Avoid showing misleading inlay hint for unpacked tuple arguments ([#22286](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22286))

### Other changes

- Sync vendored typeshed stubs ([#22302](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22302), [#22321](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22321), [#22324](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22324)).

## 0.0.1-alpha.14

### Bug fixes

- Add cycle detection to ty's implementation of disjointness between types, fixing a possible source of stack overflows when analysing recursive types ([#19139](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19139))
- Don't allow first-party code to shadow the stdlib `types` module ([#19128](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19128)).
    This fixes another possible source of stack overflows.
- Fix descriptor lookups for most types that overlap with `None` ([#19120](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19120)).
    This means that e.g. `object().__str__()` now correctly binds the `self` argument of the `__str__`
    method, as the `object` type overlaps with `None`.

### Server

- Filter a symbol from a stub file in autocomplete suggestions if it is an implementation detail of the stub ([#19121](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19121))
- Add initial support for [semantic tokens](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_semanticTokens) ([#19108](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19108)).
    This feature allows editors to apply more advanced syntax highlighting. Currently, the supported tokens are: `Namespace`, `Class`, `Parameter`, `SelfParameter`,`ClsParameter`, `Variable`, `Property`, `Function`, `Method`, `Keyword`, `String`, `Number`, `Decorator`, `BuiltinConstant` and `TypeParameter`.
- Initial support for [workspace diagnostics](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_diagnostic) ([#18939](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18939)).
    Enable this feature by setting the `ty.diagnosticMode` configuration setting to `"workspace"`.
- Use Python syntax highlighting in on-hover content ([#19082](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19082))

- Support declared-only instance attributes such as `self.x: int` ([#19048](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19048))
- Sync vendored typeshed stubs ([#19174](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19174)): [typeshed diff](https://github.com/python/typeshed/compare/3f727b0cd6620b7fca45318dd34542b1e1c7dbfb...f64707592dd3c32f756ddeebd012acb2b072aa0d)

### Bug fixes

- Avoid duplicate diagnostic when reporting errors in unpacked assignments ([#18897](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18897))
- Fix panics when "pulling types" for `ClassVar` or `Final` parameterized with >1 argument ([#18824](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18824)). These could cause issues when hovering over symbols in an IDE.

### Improved modeling of Python runtime semantics

- Add support for `@staticmethod`s ([#18809](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18809))
