# Installing ty

## Running ty without installation

Use [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to quickly get started with ty:

```shell
uvx ty
```

## Installation methods

### Adding ty to your project

!!! tip

    Adding ty as a dependency ensures that all developers on the project are using the same version
    of ty.

Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (or your project manager of choice) to add ty as a
development dependency:

```shell
uv add --dev ty
```

Then, use `uv run` to invoke ty:

```shell
uv run ty
```

To update ty, use `--upgrade-package`:

```shell
uv lock --upgrade-package ty
```

### Installing globally with uv

Install ty globally with uv:

```shell
uv tool install ty@latest
```

To update ty, use `uv tool upgrade`:

```shell
uv tool upgrade ty
```

### Installing with the standalone installer

ty includes a standalone installer.

=== "macOS and Linux"

    Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ty/install.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```console
    $ wget -qO- https://astral.sh/ty/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ty/0.0.18/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Use `irm` to download the script and execute it with `iex`:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/ty/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/ty/0.0.18/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

!!! tip

    The installation script may be inspected before use:

    === "macOS and Linux"

        ```console
        $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ty/install.sh | less
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```pwsh-session
        PS> powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/ty/install.ps1 | more"
        ```

    Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](#installing-from-github-releases).

### Installing from GitHub Releases

ty release artifacts can be downloaded directly from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases).

## Adding ty to your editor

See the [editor integration](./editors.md) guide to add ty to your editor.

## Shell autocompletion

!!! tip

    You can run `echo $SHELL` to help you determine your shell.

To enable shell autocompletion for ty commands, run one of the following:

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(ty generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(ty generate-shell-completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== "fish"

    ```bash
    echo 'ty generate-shell-completion fish | source' > ~/.config/fish/completions/ty.fish
    ```

=== "Elvish"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (ty generate-shell-completion elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
    ```

=== "PowerShell / pwsh"

    ```powershell
    if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
      New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
    }
    Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& ty generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
    ```

Then restart the shell or source the shell config file.
